                Pierre-Emerick Emiliano François Aubameyang (born 18 June 1989) is a professional footballer who plays as a forward and is the captain of both Premier League club Arsenal[5] and the Gabon national team. He is considered to be one of the best strikers in the world, known for his pace, finishing, and off-ball movement.[6] Aubameyang plays mainly as a striker, but has also been deployed as a wide forward.
            
                Aubameyang began his senior career at Serie A club A.C. Milan, eventually being promoted to the first team in 2008 after impressing as a member of the club's youth setup. However, he never featured for Milan, and instead, began a series of loan spells in France. His loan move to Ligue 1 team Saint-Étienne was made permanent in 2011. During his time at the club, Aubameyang helped the club win the 2012–13 Coupe de la Ligue and was honored in the Ligue 1 Team of the Year. Aubameyang joined Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund in 2013, where he finished as the league's top goalscorer in the 2016–17 season and won the DFB-Pokal title.[7] He also became the club's sixth all-time top goalscorer. In 2018, Aubameyang signed for English team Arsenal in a deal worth £56 million (€64 million), making him the most expensive Gabonese player of all time.[8] In his first full season in England, he won the Premier League Golden Boot (shared with Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah). He lifted the FA Cup the following season, scoring two goals for Arsenal in both the semi-finals and the final, becoming just the fifth player to score two or more goals in a cup match at Wembley on more than one occasion.[9]
                
                He is multilingual and speaks French, English, Spanish, Italian, and German.[97]

                Aubameyang was invited to play for Italy U19s after a good season with Dijon, but he debuted for the France under-21 team in February 2009 in a friendly match against Tunisia.[84]

                Aubameyang was also eligible to play for Spain because he has Spanish nationality. He decided to represent Gabon because his father once captained the team, but he maintains close relationship with Spain and dreams to play in La Liga.[85][86]

                On 25 March 2009, Aubameyang was selected for the Gabon national team[87] and made his debut for the squad. He scored his first goal in a 3–2 victory over Morocco, then scored a goal each in friendly matches against Benin, Togo, Algeria and Senegal.[88]

                Aubameyang was a key member of the Gabon national side that reached the quarter-finals of the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations as co-hosts of the competition. He netted three goals in total, finishing the tournament as one of the top scorers. On 5 February 2012, he set up the opening goal for his team and hit the post in the quarter-final against Mali. However, the match ended 1–1 after extra time and Aubameyang had his penalty saved in the shootout to decide the game.[89]

                In July 2012, Aubameyang represented Gabon at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He scored in the team's opening game against Switzerland, which was Gabon's first-ever Olympic goal, and would also prove to be Gabon's only goal of the tournament. They were eliminated in the group stage.[90]

                On 15 June 2013, Aubameyang scored a hat-trick of penalty kicks in Gabon's 4–1 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying win over Niger. He then scored a brace against Burkina Faso in the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations Qualification.[citation needed]
                
                Aubameyang captained Gabon at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, scoring the team's opening goal of the tournament in their 2–0 win over Burkina Faso on 17 January 2015.[91] He also scored a brace against Mali on 25 March 2015. He is Gabon's highest goalscorer. He rejected a callup for a pivotal World Cup qualifier at home to the Ivory Coast, which they lost 3–0.[92]

In the process, Aubameyang also became the first Gabonese player to appear in the Bundesliga.[19] On 27 November, he scored his first Champions League goal in a 3–1 win against Napoli in the group stage of the 2013–14 competition.[20] He later took a penalty against 1860 Munich that propelled Dortmund into the next round of the 2013–14 DFB-Pokal, finishing the year with 13 league goals and 16 goals in all competitions.[ci</p>
